    THINGS TO DO.
Overall:
  1. think about how to overall design looks and change it up\
  2. add a header and footer. I'm inserting a bootstrap link of every page
  3. might even have to get rid of bootstrap and go for plain css???
  4. go through each page and remove unneded things
  5. need to add a contact page where a  user can input info and send me an email
  6. Maybe add a resume section to the website?
  7. Maybe add a back to top option at the bottom of the views (probably only if I add a lot of scroll content)
      -might just include it as a footer
Landing Page:
  1. Add photo
  2. Think of an intro to replace text under name
  3. delete "About" and add it to the right
  4. create about page
  5. Remove "Explore"?? either that or maybe it should go to portfolio

Portfolio Page:
  1. Back to Home Page button should be at the top. (Maybe add a navbar?)
  2. Simple-Shooter needs a better game name
  3. All games need a better description
  4. Create a page for each game and add information
  5. Delete "Secondary action" button. (unless you can think of a good use for it)
  6. space out the "Details & GitHub" buttons
  7. Link each GitHub to the page. (make sure each game has a README on GitHub first).
  8. think about seperating video game projects and others (school projects, senior project, other web projects)
  9. for Unreal Engine projects it might be a good idea to mention the tutorial
        or just mention it in the READMEs on github
  10. maybe order the games differently
