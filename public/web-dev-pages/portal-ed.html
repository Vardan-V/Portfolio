            <p class="lead">
              This is a website/mobile application that I worked on for my Senior Project.
              I worked in a team of eight, employing agile methodologies such as daily standups,
              continous communication and delivery.
              <br><br>
              PortalEd is a web-based application that allows teachers to efficiently record a student's attendance, behavior, 
              and academic engagement using a simple and intuitive color-based scheme. It also  allows parents/legal guardians to see how their child is performing 
              at any given moment.
              <br>
              <br>
              This application notifies the parents/legal guardians of the student in the event that the student is absent, and/or requires immediate attention
              regarding their academics and behavior. This allows for deeper engagement and communication between parents and schools.

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Website</h2>
            <p class="lead">The PortalEd website is used by teachers and counselors. When the site is opened, the user will be asked
              for their username and password. If the user account is owned by a counselor, they will be redirected to "Counselor View".
              From here, the counselor will enter the student's ID and be redirected to that student's overview page. From there they may click
              on a specific period to see a history of infractions that the student may have had for that class. 
              <br>
              <br>
              When teachers login, they will be redirected to the "Teacher View" where they can start a class by clicking on the period and confirming.
              From here they can record student academics, attendance, and behavior simply by clicking on the respective icon 
              underneath the student's name. At the end of the period, the teacher may end their class session which will update the performance
              for each student in the database for that class.

            <p class="lead">
              The mobile application was designed for parents and legal guardians of the students.
              When the parent signs into the app, they will see a list of their children and the number of alerts each have.
              If they have alerts, they will need to acknowledge them to proceed. From there, they will be able to see the "Student Overview"
              page and see how their child is performing for each period.
